1. How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add. 


   I spent about 8 hours. 
   
   
   If I had more time, I would:


   add postcode as parameter and try several different postcode. 
   add more detailed verification/test objects.
   change fixed delay to conditional wait


1. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation? 


   hyper automation. Automation is performed using RPA/AI/ML/NLP. 

1. How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this? 


   Identify parts of the application that can be decoupled, and componentise them, defining interfaces where possible. 
   This will make it possible to automate testing in smaller, more manageable chunks.


   Yes, I have done that in several places.


1. How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website? 


   Search criteria only allow postal code, and no message/hint for valid postal code. 


   To improve customer experience, search should allow address in addition to postal code. For invalid address/postal code, message should provide valid postal code format.
